# Now V2 Update
Unforatunately, I haven't figure out how to port this over to Now V2 since they no longer support running arbitrary Docker containers. This will not work unless you have an older now.sh account that has been grandfathered in to still supporting V1.

# Nmap Scan
This serverless function wraps an Express app around a basic Nmap scan. It listens for a single URL query called `host` and then executes a fast nmap scan against it with the following options:

```
nmap -Pn -F -sT $host
```

The normal nmap output is captured and then returned in the HTTP response.

This is useful for quickly scanning a target IP from an external source. Quicker than SSHing into a VPS to run a quick Nmap scan 

## Deployment 
```
$ now --public
```

If you want to change the arguments of the `nmap` scan (e.g. run a script or look for more ports), you'll need to change the following line in `index.js`:

```
const command = spawn('nmap', ['-Pn', '-F', '-sT', host]);
```

Note: longer nmap scans will probably time out the HTTP connection before they finish

## Usage
The function expects a `host` parameter sent via a GET request:

```
$ curl "https://nmapscan-qijgjnaats.now.sh?host=blog.ropnop.com"
